In order to create big things, you don’t need a MacBook, three 27” screens, 300$ headphones and an expensive, aeshetically looking desk.

Social networks like Instagram are promoting stuff like that, but it’s not relevant.

When I studied programming, I was coding on a dusty, 6 years old Acer laptop. I didn’t have an office with fancy standing desk – I coded in a public library or a noizy coffee shop.

Don’t get discouraged if you can’t afford expensive hardware or a premium coding school. Look for cheaper or free alternatives. Buy used books.

It's not setup that makes a difference. It's you.
