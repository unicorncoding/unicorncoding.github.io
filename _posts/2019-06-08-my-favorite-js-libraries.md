Every day I write a lot of JavaScript code. Here is the top 5 libraries that I use across different projects.

**[Day.js](//github.com/iamkun/dayjs){: rel="nofollow" }** — a fast 2kB library that simplifies working with dates. I like it more than heavy moment.js – it’s lightweight and has lots of useful extensions.

**[Axios.js](//github.com/axios/axios){: rel="nofollow" }** — a flexible HTTP client that uses promises. It works in all browsers and in Node.js.

**[Commander.js](//github.com/tj/commander.js){: rel="nofollow" }** — a library for creating command-line apps. Sometimes I am too lazy to build graphical user interface (GUI).


**[Debug.js](//github.com/visionmedia/debug){: rel="nofollow" }** – a library that you should use if you're still writing console.log() statements. It makes debugging much easier!

**[Cheerio](//github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio){: rel="nofollow" }** – it's a jQuery for the server, useful for HTML traversing. When a website does not have an API, you can download the HTML and process it with Cheerio. Works like charm!

What are you favorite JS libraries?
