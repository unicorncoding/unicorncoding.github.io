I do a lot of front-end development, and building UI is part of the job. I have tried many UI component libraries in action, and here is a top 4 list of my favorites.

* **Bulma** is powerful yet straightforward CSS framework. It's open source, responsive, and modular. It's pure CSS and works with any JS framework. Bulma is my go-to solution for most of my projects. ❤️ I love you, [Bulma](bulma.io){: rel="nofollow" }.
⠀

* **Bootstrap** is the most popular design toolkit. The power of [Bootstrap](getbootstrap.com){: rel="nofollow" }  lies in thousands of free and commercial themes available for download. Since Bootstrap is not pure CSS and relies heavily on JS, there are different non-official Bootstrap implementations available for Vue, Angular, and React. That's why I choose Bulma, when possible.

* **Matter**  is a set of Material Design components, written in pure CSS. You add a single CSS class to your HTML element, and it gets "materialized." When my customers prefer Google Material Design, I choose [Matter](github.com/finnhvman/matter){: rel="nofollow" }.

* **Element** is a component library for Vue.js. I love Vue, and when it comes to choosing a component library, I prefer Bulma. But Bulma misses some advanced components, such as steps or infinite scroll. In that case, I rely on [Element](https://element.eleme.cn){: rel="nofollow" }.
