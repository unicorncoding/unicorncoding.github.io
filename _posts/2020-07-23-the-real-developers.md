Some dudes in the IT community think that "the real developers" must: 
* have a beard and greasy hair 
* wear a stinky oversized t-shirt 
* drink cheap beer 
* shit in comments

Otherwise, you're not a programmer; and you'll be reminded of that every day: ⠀ 

– "Programmers don't look like that!" 

– "You're fake. Some dude writes your content.”

– "Are you a model or a coder?"

Surprise: programmers can be different. Stop judging by the cover. Otherwise – fuck you. 🖕
