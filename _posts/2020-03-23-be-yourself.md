Every day, thousands of people try to get a job at GAFAM (Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft). Books, articles, and videos help you prepare and "crack" the coding interview. Even insiders exist who help you get the job faster for a hiring bounty ($$$).

People believe that GAFAM is the best place to work, but it's far from the truth. There is no single best place to work. What makes someone happy, makes others feel miserable. 

Instead of working your ass off preparing to GAFAM interview, coming up with "good answers" to questions, memorizing hundreds of algorithms and data structures, and finally landing a job you don't like, I recommend a different strategy:

**Prepare less and be authentic.** Only by being yourself can you find a workplace you'll genuinely enjoy. Try different companies. There is a company out there that needs you and only you, because of your unique combination of personal traits, skills, and weaknessses!

Just be yourself. You are the best at it.
