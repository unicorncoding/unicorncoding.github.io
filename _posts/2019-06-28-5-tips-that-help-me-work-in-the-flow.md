1️⃣ **Disable all notifications on your laptop**. This will take away distractions. I also turn off ringtone on my mobile phone. If you use iPhone, you can enable Emergency Bypass to keep receiving calls from your family.

2️⃣ **Block distracting websites such as social media, videos, games, or email**. LeechBlock can help you do that. If it doesn't help, have a separate OS user for coding, with only coding tools installed. Social networks, messengers and email clients are either removed or blocked.

3️⃣ **Plan your day in advance**. I try to schedule all non-coding activities for the evening, when I am least productive. I prefer coding from 9:00 to 16:00 and have a round of continuous meetings from 16:00 to 18:00, than to code from 9:00 to 10:00, attend a meeting, code again... Interruption is evil.

4️⃣ **If you work from home, define house rules**. My rule is simple – when my room locked, I am in Do Not Disturb mode. If I open the door – I am open for interruption. If you work in the office, you can agree on quiet hours that everyone respects. During quiet hours, no one can to talk to each other.

5️⃣ **Deep focus requires beeing in present moment**. To be in present moment, you have to make sure that your mind is not wandering.
