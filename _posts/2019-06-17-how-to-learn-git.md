1️⃣ **[Getting Started](//bit.ly/git_simple){: rel="nofollow" }** - the best and most straightforward guide for getting started with Git. No complicated stuff, only the basic commands.

2️⃣ **[Learn Git concepts](//bit.ly/unicorn_git){: rel="nofollow" }** – an interactive tutorial meant to teach you how Git works, not just which commands to execute.

3️⃣ **[Branching Guide](//learngitbranching.js.org){: rel="nofollow" }** – an interactive and visual tutorial has helped me understand and use Git branching effectively.

4️⃣ **[Flight Rules](//bit.ly/flight_rules){: rel="nofollow" }** – an excellent guide that I use when things go wrong, and I have no idea how to fix the issue. Unlike StackOverflow answers, this guide is kept up to date with the latest Git version.

5️⃣ **[Cheat Sheet](//bit.ly/unicorn_gitcs){: rel="nofollow" }** – it's very convenient to keep a printed Git Cheat Sheet on your desk. It helps you look up commands quickly without Googling.
