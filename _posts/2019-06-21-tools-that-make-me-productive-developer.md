1Ô∏è‚É£ **[Dash](//kapeli.com/dash){: rel="nofollow" }** ‚Äì it's a tool for searching documentation quickly, without even opening a browser. It has more than 200+ doc sets and works offline. If you are not Mac user, [Zeal](//zealdocs.org){: rel="nofollow" } is a good alternative.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **[Hyper](//hyper.is){: rel="nofollow" }** ‚Äì it's a beautiful and extensible Terminal that works on all operating systems. I like it much more than a standard terminal on my Mac.
