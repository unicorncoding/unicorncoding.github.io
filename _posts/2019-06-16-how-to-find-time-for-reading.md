I know how hard it is to find time for reading a book, but reading is essential for a software developer.

I read roughly 30 pages a day and almost have no special reading timе.📚 🕐

How does it work?

I always carry a book in a backpack or have an eBook downloaded on my phone.

Then I try to:

* read while standing in a queue
* read while waiting for lunch being served
* read while waiting for someone
* read while commuting (bus, train, taxi, plane)
* read while walking (here be dragons)

If you read 30 page a day, or approximately 2 books a month, in a few years you'll have a good understanding of industry best practices and distinguish yourself from nearly everyone around you. 🎓
